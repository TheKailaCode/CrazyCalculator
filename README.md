<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<strong>Tech Used:</strong> <em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em>

<p>The calculator was created using OOP to reduce the repetiveness of adding code for each possible function of the calculator.</p>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

<p>I changed the button functoning to include an all clear (AC) button to change the calculator display screen back to zero. </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

<p>Start off small. It was important to remember this while attempting to add function such as addition, subtraction, and multiplicaton to my calculator. I had to decide what basic functons should my calculator absolutely have and then expand the use from there. </p>
